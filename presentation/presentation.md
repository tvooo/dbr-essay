# Accessible Design Knowledge

* More design knowledge should be published
* Published design knowledge needs to be in a proper format

This does not only benefit other designers; it also benefits the institutions involved and, most importantly, society.

Good examples, bad examples.

Inspiration: great artists steal.

# We need an effortless, natural way to publish design knowledge as we go
