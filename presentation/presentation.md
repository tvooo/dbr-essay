# Accessible Design Knowledge

* More design knowledge should be published
* Published design knowledge needs to be in a proper format

This does not only benefit other designers; it also benefits the institutions involved and, most importantly, society.

Good examples, bad examples.

# Inspiration

* Open Source
* Open Knowledge
* Open Patenting
* Open Innovation
* ~~Open Design~~

In academia, you are free to build on someone else’s knowledge.

# Non-design examples

It’s super-hard to distinguish between design and non-design

## Eclipse

## Patents

* Tesla releases patents to the public
* Linux thingie
* Quirky users can search for and use GE patents in their inventions

# Design examples

Getting there…

## Fairphone

How can a phone that respects the environment and human rights be made?

* Transparency (cost breakdown, suppliers, social assessment report, 
* Repair, recycle if possible

## Lindängen Library

* We used the *paper cup* ideation method, and it served us really well
* It was inspired by a workshop by *Unsworn Industries* with Malmö Library during Dar’s TP1

## Building theguardian.com

* *Inside the Guardian* blog
* Talks
* Styleguide
* Open Source repository
* Interviews, articles in other media

Still, too tech-oriented

# Intellectual property

Licensing: Here’s my work (knowledge), and this is what you’re allowed to do with it.

Foundations

Inspiration: great artists steal.
That’s what happens with cheap ripoffs. But the bad copy of an iPhone is not an iPhone just because it looks like one. The copier did copy the what, but not the why.

# We need an effortless, natural way to publish design knowledge as we go

Integrated in practice.

In open source, developers communicate their knowledge through their own medium, through their product, which is code.

Design communicates way more mediated, through the product or academic papers or blog entries. A lot more selective, polished, narrow. More WHAT.
