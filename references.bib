  abstract = {This paper reviews diverse examples of "research through design" in {HCI}. Various forms and functions of design research artifacts are highlighted, including 3 general types: (1) operational design prototypes and products, (2) conceptual and material design studies and experiments and (3) design proposals. The role of both design artifacts and the research publication itself are highlighted. These roles are further explicated through the concepts of verbal articulation, design articulation, and concept-things. As concluding questions/provocations, the notions of thingly publications, pure design research, and making design research artifacts more public are offered for the {HCI} community and {DIS} conference in particular},
